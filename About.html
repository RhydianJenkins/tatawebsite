<i>About Tata Steel Sailing Club</i>
</h6>
<h3> Location</h3>
</p>

<p2>Tata Steel Sailing Club is located just off Junction 38 of the M4.<br/> If traveling from the East, i.e. traveling from the Cardiff direction take the first exit off the J38 roundabout.
<br/>If traveling from the West, i.e.  traveling, from the Swansea direction take the 3rd exit off the J38 roundabout. <br/><br/>The exit off the roundabout is signposted "Crematorium".

<br/>Speed limit on the reservoir roads is 20mph. You will see the club house on your right on a promontory into the reservoir. Look out for the right turn, up a narrow lane, which is obscured by bushes as you approach.<br><br>
To gain entry to the reservoir you will need the code to the sailing club's combination lock;  this is given to members when membership fees have been paid.  Visitors, or prospective members who may be interested in finding out more about the club  need to ring the clubhouse on 07951 553 488;  a member will then come to the gate to let you in</p><br/><hr/>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eglwys Nunydd is the name given to an area
of land South East of Margam which at one time was a Grange belonging to Margam
Abbey. It is often thought that there was a Nunnery or even a Convent there but
this is not the case. Eglwys Nunydd was not a Convent, but from records of the
16<sup>th</sup> Century there existed a pre Norman church named Eglwys Nunney
which was thought to be dedicated to Saint Non the mother of Saint David. Over
the many years the name has become altered until today the area is called
Eglwys Nunedd.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span></span><span lang=EN-GB

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The reservoir was constructed on marshy
land within this area by surrounding the marsh with walls on three sides and
allowing the area to flood. “The Steel Company of Wales Sailing Club” from whom
we are descended, moved to this artificial lake in 1963 having previously
sailed on <st1:place w:st="on">Port Talbot</st1:place> docks. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It has been suggested that the “Club” may
be sailing on Holy water. Should this be true then there are many members who
have experienced an involuntary baptism.</span></p>

<h3>
<i>The Early Years</i></h3>
<p>The Club was founded in 1953 and moved to its present site in 1963 and is a section of to the Tata Steel Sports and Social club. It is open to Tata Steel employees and all members of the public wishing to sail mono hull dinghies and windsurfers throughout the  whole year.<p>Originally with the Steel Company of Wales Sailing Club sailing took place in works holding pools and later moved to the docks of Port Talbot. The Steel Company of Wales became part of British Steel in 1957. Under the stewardship of Mr Fred Cartwright who was the manager of the the British Steel works at Port        Talbot and Mr Ray James who was the planning engineer Eglwys        Nunydd&nbsp; reservoir was opened in 1963 to service the works. Both        keen sailors they were instrumental in moving the works sailing club from the docks to the        reservoir.</p>
<p>In 1957 the Porthcawl and Kenfig sailing club was founded        using Kenfig pool, now part of Kenfig nature reserve, as a base. During        the 1966 season it became clear to the members that the British Steel        sailing club provided a size and facilities which would much better        suite the development of sailing. Porthcawl and Kenfig sailing club was        disbanded and its members joined the British steel sailing club.<p>As a        result of this &quot;merger&quot; there followed a period of close        association between Porthcawl and British Steel sailing club which can        be seen from the clubs trophy cabinet.        <blockquote>          <ul>            <li>The Offshore Challenge Shield - originally presented to the club              by Porthcawl Town Council. Councilor David Howell-Jones was chair              of Porthcawl Town council and was instrumental in providing sponsorship.              The offshore race was originally held off Porthcawl and is now              awarded to the winning Corus club member at the Llanstephan Offshore              Weekend.</li>            <li>Porthcawl and Kenfig Open Regatta Trophy (awarded between 1957              and 1966)</li>            <li>Porthcawl Marine Fireball Cup</li>          </ul>        </blockquote>        <p>The association with the steel works is also represented by a number of        trophies.</p>        <blockquote>          <ul>            <li>The Commanders Anchor - engraved SCWYC (Steel Company of Wales              Sailing Club) and first awarded in 1966</li>            <li>The Junior Champion Helmsman Challenge Cup, engraved with the              letters SCWYC and first awarded in 1957.</li>            <li>The Handsome Transom originally awarded for the Enterprise              class and being in the shape of a dinghy transom. Presented to              the club by Mr Fred Cartwright.</li>          </ul>        </blockquote>        <p>The club began to outgrow the clubhouse which was of wooden        construction. Under the clubs longest serving commodore, Arthur Gough, a        new clubhouse was constructed. Arthur was a draftsman at British Steel        and drew the plans up himself. A loan of £10,000 was arranged with        British Steel to be paid back over 10 years. Construction was undertaken        by the Borough of Afan Community Program Agency with help from British        Steel and club members as part of the Manpower Services Commission  Community Program. The new clubhouse was opened on the 14th September 1985 by Mr. D C Williams M.A. J.P. Chairman, Area Manpower Board. A plaque above the kitchen servery commemorates the event. The old wooden clubhouse was removed and rebuild adjacent to the British Steel Sports  and Social club where it remains to this day and is used as the Band practice room.
