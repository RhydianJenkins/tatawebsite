        <h4>Bio-security warning</h4>
        <p>We have a non European shrimp at Eglwys Nunnydd Reservoir.</p>
        <p>Although completely harmless to humans, it does have a seriously adverse effect on UK freshwater life, eggs etc., in fresh and brackish water.</p>
        <p>The following measures have been introduced to minimise the likelihood of sailors and windsurfers spreading this creature to other water catchment areas: Before any dinghy sailor or windsurfer takes their craft away from Tata Steel Sailing Club.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must not leave any trolley or trailer in the water when launching.</li>
            <li>You are required to inspect your craft for shrimp and weed etc., and thoroughly wash with the hoses provided. Pay particular attention to washing sails, masts, and other nooks and crannies such as Topper and Laser mast holes, slots on sailboards etc.</li>
            <li>Trolleys, which have been immersed in the water, need special attention to ensure hollow tubes are flushed through â€“ pay attention to wheels and support cradles.</li>
            <li>Your craft and trolley needs to be completely drained after washing.</li>
            <li>You must inspect your sailing gear, including wetsuit boots, buoyancy aids, etc., and remove any shrimp</li>
            <li>Visiting powerboats and trailers need to be similarly cleaned before leaving the site, with special attention to bilges and engine cooling systems, which also need to be flushed through.</li>
        </ul>
